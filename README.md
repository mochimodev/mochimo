### Mochimo Project - Main Net Development Repository
The Mochimo Crypto Engine Main Net code is a fully functional crypto currency network node with text-based developer's wallet included. The code will compile without issue on most Linux-based gcc compatible machines with a 64-bit long. However please be aware that developer support for troubleshooting will be restricted to those users running the recommended configuration.

## Usage
Thorough instructions for configuring your system and compiling can be found on the [Mochimo Wiki](http://www.mochiwiki.com)

## Recommended Hardware/Software
The included code is designed to be run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-Bit Desktop, with at least 2 processor threads and 2GB of RAM. At present the code is designed to function on NVIDIA GPUs, and so both gcc and nvcc installations are required.
