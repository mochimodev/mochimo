# MOCHIMO CRYPTOCURRENCY ENGINE LICENSE AGREEMENT VERSION 1.0

## Plain English Preface

In plain English, this license agreement is a modified version of the
MPL 2.0 license under which Adequate Systems provides an "open source"
version of the software that underpins the Mochimo cryptocurrency
network.  This license is intended to convey to you the right to modify
the source code of the Mochimo Cryptocurrency Engine in order to make
improvements to the performance or behavior of the Mochimo
cryptocurrency network, or improvements to the tools, wallets and other
supporting software that work with the Mochimo cryptocurrency.  No other
use or modification of the code is permitted.  Within this narrow field
of use, the community may do with the software as it sees fit and
without oversight or approval by Adequate Systems.  However, please
understand that the below license does not allow you to create new
cryptocurrencies with our software, nor does it allow you to use or
modify any of Adequate Systems' software in order to make it compatible
with any other cryptocurrency projects.  Finally, this license contains
a mandatory grant back to Adequate Systems to any modifications or
improvements you might make. Please consider that carefully before
contributing your work to the Mochimo project.

        * **(3)** if the license for the Executable Form permits licensees to
            create Modifications of or Larger Works with the Original
            Software, such license must include as an express condition
            of the license the same grant-back of rights to Adequate
            Systems in such Modifications and Larger Works as You are
            required to grant to Adequate Systems under Section
            3.2(a)(ii)(1); and

### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software and the Original Software.  If the Larger Work is a
combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more
Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute
such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so
that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at the recipient’s option,
further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this
License or such Secondary License(s); provided, however, the Original
Software must always be distributed as provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2
above.

### 3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software or Original Software, except that You may alter
any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
inaccuracies.

### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software or Original Software. However, You may do so only on Your own
behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify every Contributor and Adequate Systems for any liability
incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of
warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software or Original
Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You may not
use the Covered Software or Original Software for any purpose.

## 5. Termination

**5.1.** The rights granted by Adequate Systems and by any and all
    Contributors to You under this License will terminate automatically
    and immediately if You fail to comply with any of its terms.

**5.2.** If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that the Original
    Software or a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
    any patent, then the rights granted to You by Adequate Systems for
    the Original Software and any and all Contributors for the Covered
    Software under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this License shall terminate
    immediately.

**5.3.** In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
    which have been granted by You or Your distributors under this
    License prior to termination shall also terminate.

**5.4.** Sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this License shall survive termination
    of this License for any reason.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

> Original Software and Covered Software are provided under this
> License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either
> expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation,
> warranties that the Original Software or Covered Software is free
> of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
> non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
> of the Original Software and Covered Software is with You. Should
> any Original Software or Covered Software prove defective in any
> respect, You (not Adeqaute Systems, nor any Contributor) assume
> the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
> disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
> License. No use of any Original Software or Covered Software is

> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
> (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall Adequate
> Systems nor any Contributor, nor anyone who distributes Original
> Software or Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You
> for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
> damages of any character including, without limitation, damages
> for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
> failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
> losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
> possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall
> not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
> such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits
> such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
> limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
> exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

## 8. Choice of Law and Litigation

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Florida, USA, without reference to its
conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this License in
which Adequate Systems is named as a party must be brought in the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Florida or a state court in
Hillsborough County, Florida.  Any litigation relating to this License
in which Adequate Systems is not a party may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s
ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

## 9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
Adequate Systems may freely transfer or assign this License, in whole or
in part, including an assignment of any or all rights or a delegation of
any or all duties, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide public notice of any such transfer, assignment or delegation.
You may not sublicense any rights granted to You under this License
except as provided in this License and You may not transfer or assign
this License, in whole or in part, including any assignment of any
rights or delegation of any duties, except with the prior written
consent of Adequate Systems and each applicable Contributor.  Any
purported transfer, assignment or delegation that does not comply with
this paragraph shall be void at its inception.

steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License.
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

### 10.2. Effect of New Versions
